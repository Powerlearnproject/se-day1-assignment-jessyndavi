#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software enngineering is the process of designing,building and maintaining software systems which involve coding ,testing, and managing software to make sure it works well and meets the user needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Waterfall Model- emphasizes on a linear,sequential process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Agile Model-this methodology promotes collabortion,customer feedbck and rapid delivery olf functional software and how projects are managed.
DevOps-this approach enhances continuous delivery, faster releases, and better alignment between development and operational goals.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning-defines the project scope, goals, and resources needed.
Design-creates the blueprint for the software, including architecture, interfaces, and data structures.
Development-writes the code based on the design specifications.
Testing-checks the software for bugs and verify that it meets the requirements.
Deployment-releases the software to users and make it operational.
Maintainace-updates and fix the software as needed based on user feedback and changing requirements.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology- a linear,sequential process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Advantages are: clear structure,easy to manage and good for projects with well defined requirements.
Disadvantages are: not flexible to changes, issues discovered late can be costly.
Example scenario is building  new government system where requirements are well undwerstood and unlikely to change.
Agile Methodology- an interactive approach where the peoject is divide into small cycles with regular feedback and adjustements.
Adavantages: is flexible, adaptable to changes and focuses on continuous improvement.
Disadvantages: is less predictable and requires active stakeholder involvement.
Example scenarrio: is developing a mobile app where user needs might evolve based on feedback and market trends.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- writes the code to build the software. Their responsibility is to turn requirements into a working product by designing, coding, and debugging.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer-tests the software to find and fix bugs before it’s released. They ensure the software works as intended and meets quality standards.
Project Manager- oversees the project, coordinating the team, managing timelines, and ensuring that the project stays on track and meets its goals. They act as the bridge between the team and stakeholders.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)- IDEs provide tools that help developers write, test, and debug code more efficiently. They integrate everything needed for coding in one place, like a code editor, compiler, and debugger.
Examples: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse.
Version Control Systems (VCS)- VCS track changes in the code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate, revert to previous versions, and manage different versions of the software. This prevents conflicts and data loss.
Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN), and Mercurial


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines- pressure to deliver quickly can lead to stress and errors.
Strategy: Break tasks into smaller, manageable parts, prioritize work, and communicate early about any delays.
Changing Requirements- frequent changes can disrupt the development process.
Strategy: Use Agile methods to adapt quickly, and keep open communication with stakeholders.
Debugging and Fixing Bugs- Finding and fixing issues can be time-consuming.
Strategy: Write clear, well-documented code and use automated testing tools to catch bugs early.
Keeping Up with Technology-Rapid changes in technology can make it hard to stay current.
Strategy: Regularly invest time in learning new tools and practices, and participate in tech communities.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- Tests individual pieces of code (like functions or methods) to ensure they work correctly.
Importance: Catches bugs early in the development process.
Integration Testing- Tests how different parts of the software work together.
Importance: Ensures that combined components function correctly when integrated.
System Testing- Tests the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
Importance: Validates that the complete software works as expected in a real-world environment.
Acceptance Testing-Tests the software from the user's perspective to ensure it meets their needs and requirements.
Importance: Confirms that the software is ready for delivery and use by the end-users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting clear and effective questions or statements to get the best responses from AI models.
Importance is -Better Results: Helps the AI understand exactly what you want, leading to more accurate answers.
Faster and Easier: Makes it quicker to get useful information without needing to refine your queries repeatedly.
Custom Use: Allows you to tailor the AI’s responses for specific needs or tasks.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about animals."
Improved Prompt: "List three interesting facts about elephants."
Why Improved Prompt is more effective , it's : Clear: Specifies what information is needed (facts).
Specific: Focuses on a particular animal (elephants).
Concise: Directly asks for three facts, making it easy for the AI to provide a precise response.
